	<p>
		<pre>
				This puzzle game is based on logic gate functionality. In this game the player will choose an input (0 or 1) that will satisfy the
				gate that is on the screen. Each gate will have 2 inputs, 1 given and 1 from player, and 1 output. There is the possibility for gates that
				do not have a correct answer. 
				When the game starts, there are 3 gates that fall at the same rate. Each gate will reset when the player provides an input or the gate
				reaches the end of the screen. From now on, each gate will fall a random rate of speed. When the gate responds, the type of gate is randomly
				selected.
				If the player provides the correct value to satisfy the gate, the player receives 100 points. If the player provides an incorrect value to
				the gate, the player will lose a life. The player starts off with 10 lives and 0 points. The game ends when the player has 0 lives left.
